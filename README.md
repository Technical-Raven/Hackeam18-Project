## ITS WIP NOT YET WORKING FULLY
The problem is based around rural/sub urban trek. What we are trying to solve is of the lack of workers in rural/farm works. In our trek we analysed that no worker generally wants to work in farm even if paid well. 
To solve this we are trying to connect farmers to unemployed people needy of work, like poor homeless.
We are making a platform(cross platform) which allows users registration in 2 categories i.e., farmers and brokers. Farmers can regisrer and post the work they need to be done i.e., amount of the worker they require and wage they are willing to pay. Brokers are  just normal people who generally encounter such people in their day to day life. They can register and connect workers to works available on platform for some commission in between.
